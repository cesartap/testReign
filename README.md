This is the code for te test.
This test was developed with nodeJs and Express as backend and angular with material as frontend and MongoDB as persistence.

Mongo is in an EC2 instance by amazon
the frontend is developed with lambda functions and angular serverless. 
the backend as well is developed with lambda functions.

the DB access is not granted to anyone, just for me because is a paid service depending on the usage. but the DB already have some values deleted.
